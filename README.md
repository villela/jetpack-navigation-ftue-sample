# About the Fork

This fork swaps Dagger for Toothpick, a scoped based DI library, for the sake of sanity. 

# Jetpack Navigation + Fragments + NavGraphs + SavedStateHandle + Dagger + AssistedInject + EventEmitter (toasts / navigation commands)

This is a sample repository for the aforementioned tools (primarily Jetpack Navigation + NavGraph-scoped ViewModel + SavedStateHandle + Dagger + AssistedInject).

The sample is based on the FTUE-rewrite in [Simple-Stack Tutorial: First-Time User Experience with RxJava](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack-tutorials/tree/93554f7000efe49fca39de7ca707eb6843a5eaf8/app/src/main/java/com/zhuinden/simplestacktutorials/steps/step_9).

. . .

The original version of the "FTUE sample" is based on the ["Conditional Navigation" section of Jetpack Navigation documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-conditional#first-time_user_experience).

Please beware that the original FTUE approach outlined in the documentation of Jetpack Navigation has various anti-patterns that are fixed in this sample:

- Jetpack Navigation docs uses `by activityViewModels()` instead of properly scoping the ViewModel to the `NavBackStackEntry` of the `registration_graph`

- Jetpack Navigation docs does NOT care about process death at all, while this sample uses the `lifecycle-viewmodel-savedstate` artifact and `SavedStateHandle` to properly survive across process death

- Jetpack Navigation docs claim you must have the `startDestination` on your graph at all times, in this sample we can clearly see a "splash" to make conditional navigation based on auth state.

- In general, Google samples rely on `LiveData<Event<T>>` (which should be considered an anti-pattern) and delegate Navigation responsibilities to the Fragment, in this sample we rely on `EventEmitter` to invoke `NavController` methods from the `ViewModel` directly.
